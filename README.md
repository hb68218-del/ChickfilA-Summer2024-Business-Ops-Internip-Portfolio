This repository showcases my **Business Operations Internship Portfolio** from my Summer 2024 internship at Chick-fil-A Conyers. The project documents how I applied data analysis, operational metrics, and process improvement methods to real-world restaurant operations, with a focus on improving service speed, customer experience, and operational efficiency.

Throughout the internship, I worked closely with store leadership to analyze performance data, identify operational bottlenecks, and support data-driven decisions across drive-thru operations, staffing, and customer engagement. Using tools such as Customer Engagement Management (CEM) data, transaction-level analysis, and operational reporting, I evaluated key performance drivers including speed of service, fulfillment time, and daypart efficiency.

The objective of this project was not only to assess operational performance, but to translate analytical insights into practical, actionable recommendations. These included staffing adjustments, process improvements, and support for technology adoption such as the Vehicle Detection System (VDS), with the goal of balancing efficiency, customer experience, and operational feasibility in a fast-paced, customer-facing environment.
