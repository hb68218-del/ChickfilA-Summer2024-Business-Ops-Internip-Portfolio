## Project Objective

This project documents my Summer 2024 Business Operations & Analytics Internship at Chick-fil-A Conyers. The primary objective was to analyze drive-thru operations, identify bottlenecks, and support data-driven decision making to improve speed of service, staffing efficiency, customer experience, and overall operational performance in a high-volume, customer-facing environment.

The project combines operational analysis, observational data collection, and applied analytics to translate real-world business challenges into actionable improvement strategies.

## Project Overview

During my internship, I worked closely with store leadership to evaluate drive-thru performance across different dayparts and service conditions. The project required balancing quantitative analysis with on-the-ground operational insights, including firsthand observation of drive-thru workflows, team member coordination, and customer interactions.

Using a mix of internal reports, observational data, and manual time studies, I analyzed operational inefficiencies and collaborated with leadership to propose and implement practical solutions.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel (data logging, analysis, and charts)  
- Chick-fil-A Analytics Hub  
- Customer Engagement Management (CEM) survey data  
- Drive-thru evaluation checklists and time studies  
- Operational observation and process mapping  

---

## Data Used in This Project

The analysis leveraged multiple data sources, including:

- Drive-thru time and throughput observations  
- Transaction volume by daypart  
- Customer engagement survey results  
- Internal operational metrics and reports  
- In-person inspections and observational notes  

These data sources were combined to evaluate performance trends and identify operational bottlenecks.

## Project Tasks Completed

### Drive-Thru Speed and Throughput Analysis
- Conducted drive-thru inspections during breakfast, lunch, and dinner  
- Logged time stamps for key service stages  
- Analyzed average fulfillment times and transaction volume by daypart  

### Bottleneck Identification
- Identified operational constraints related to order-taking devices, staffing allocation, and workflow design  
- Evaluated physical layout limitations impacting speed of service  
- Assessed training and process consistency across shifts  

### Customer Engagement Analysis
- Analyzed Customer Engagement Management (CEM) survey results  
- Identified strengths and weaknesses in speed, order accuracy, and service quality  
- Connected customer feedback trends with operational findings  

### Process Improvement Recommendations
- Developed targeted improvement strategies for drive-thru order lines and meal delivery zones  
- Proposed equipment placement, signage, and staffing adjustments  
- Outlined clear implementation steps for leadership consideration

## Results and Impact

As a result of the implemented improvements and operational adjustments:

- Achieved new drive-thru car count records during peak breakfast and lunch hours  
- Recorded a **4.2 percent increase in drive-thru sales**  
- Improved speed of service during high-volume periods  
- Strengthened alignment between staffing levels and transaction demand  

These outcomes demonstrate the impact of combining analytics with operational execution in a fast-paced retail environment.
