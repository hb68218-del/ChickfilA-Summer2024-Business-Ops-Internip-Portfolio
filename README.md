## Project Introduction

This repository showcases my **Business Operations Internship Portfolio** from my Summer 2024 internship at Chick-fil-A Conyers. The project documents how I applied data analysis, operational metrics, and process improvement methods to real-world restaurant operations, with a focus on improving service speed, customer experience, and operational efficiency.

Throughout the internship, I worked closely with store leadership to analyze performance data, evaluate operational bottlenecks, and support data-driven decisions across drive-thru operations, staffing, and customer engagement. The portfolio highlights how analytical insights were translated into actionable improvements in a fast-paced, customer-facing environment.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project was to use operational and customer data to identify inefficiencies, evaluate performance drivers, and recommend practical improvements to restaurant operations.

Specifically, this project aimed to:
- Analyze speed of service and fulfillment time metrics to identify operational bottlenecks  
- Evaluate customer engagement and satisfaction trends using Customer Engagement Management (CEM) data  
- Assess staffing efficiency across different dayparts using transaction-level analysis  
- Support decision making around process improvements and technology adoption, including the Vehicle Detection System (VDS)  

The goal was not only to analyze performance, but to translate insights into recommendations that balanced efficiency, customer experience, and operational feasibility.
